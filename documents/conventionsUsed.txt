Naming convention Used

Classes	Class names should be nouns in UpperCamelCase, with the first letter of every word capitalised. Use whole words — avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).	
Example: RegExp, TypeError, XMLHttpRequest, DOMObject


Methods	Methods should be verbs in lowerCamelCase; that is, with the first letter lowercase and the first letters of subsequent words in uppercase.	
Example: getElementById, getElementsByTagNameNS, createCDATASection


Variables	Local variables, instance variables, and class variables are also written in lowerCamelCase. Variable names should not start with underscore (_) or dollar sign ($) characters, even though both are allowed. Certain coding conventions state that underscores should be used to prefix all instance variables, for improved reading and program understanding.
Variable names should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a variable name should be mnemonic — that is, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use. One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary "throwaway" variables. Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.
int i;
char c;
float myWidth;


Constants	Constants should be written in uppercase characters separated by underscores. Constant names may also contain digits if appropriate, but not as the first character.
